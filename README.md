It alerts guardians of the user when there are in danger and further alerts the police offices if no further action is taken by the person in danger. It offers different activation methods to summon assisstance effortlessly irrespective of time and place. Another point to note is the fact that it allows you to enter as many guardians as possible. Your Guardian makes sure that your safety is our responsibility.

# Diagrams
The user log's in to the page which allows them to enter the details of themselves. As the next step it allows them to enter the details of their Guardians. It instructs the user to turn on the location and neccessary steps to follow to ensure smooth execution of the app. The app stores the data entered by the user and it will share the data to the authorities in times of need. Building upon the earlier statement when its activated, it first alerts the Guardians entered by the user and if there is no further response, within two minutes it will notify the officials; following this, they will able to take the needed actions.
